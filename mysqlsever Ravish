What Is MySQL Database Management Server?
  MySQL is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). It stores data in tables, using rows and columns, just like Excel — but more powerful and secure.

A MySQL Database Server is the computer (or EC2 instance) where MySQL is installed and running. This server stores, manages, processes, and secures the data for applications


What MySQL Server Does
*** Stores Data{ Everything goes into databases → inside tables}
*** Ensures security{Only allowed users can access or change the data}
***Manages relationships{Using primary keys, foreign keys, joins}
*** Performs SQL queries{SQL = Structured Query Language}

You will create two EC2 instances (both Ubuntu)
  MySQL Database Server
  MySQL Client
  
  Log in to your AWS Management Console.
Launch the First Instance (MySQL Server)

Update & Upgrade Both Servers
 sudo apt update -y
sudo apt upgrade -y

Install MySQL Server on the Server Machine
  sudo apt install -y mysql-server


     After installation, start and enable the service so it runs automatically
sudo systemctl enable mysql
sudo systemctl start mysql
sudo systemctl status mysql

Install MySQL Client on the Client Machine
sudo apt install -y mysql-client

Create a Database and a Remote User
sudo mysql -u root -p

Open Port 3306 on AWS Security Group
  Type: MySQL/Aurora
  Port Range: 3306

  Connect from MySQL Client to Server
  Enter the password:

 Mysql Show databases.

You have deloyed a fully functional MySQL Client-Server set up.
